# MSA_Phase1

The app gives temperature information for different cities, user has to type in the name of the city. 

Update
The app works now, the problem was with the dependencies and had to run npm install again after deleting all the node modules
Previous Issue
For some reason I could not get the app to work on Azure

Material-UI card view has been used to display the temperature, navgiation bar is also use of material-ui
